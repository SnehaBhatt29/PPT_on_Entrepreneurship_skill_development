# PowerPointPresentation_on_Entrepreneurship_skill_development

This ESD (Entrepreneurship Skill Development) College assesment project, focused on Urban Development, showcases a comprehensive business plan for a Schedule-Shared Ride service with multiple travel options. The PowerPoint presentations were meticulously designed by me, reflecting a professional and cohesive visual style.

In collaboration with my partner, I contributed extensively to:

- **Competitive Analysis:** Assisted in evaluating competitors to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
- **SWOT Analysis:** Helped in performing a detailed SWOT analysis to understand the internal and external factors impacting our business plan.
- **Market Research:** Conducted thorough market research to gather data on potential customers, market trends, and industry insights.
- **Market Analysis:** Analyzed the collected data to inform strategic decisions and identify key market opportunities.
- **Data Analysis:** Analysed Survey data in Excel which was collected from a google form.

This project highlights my skills in designing professional presentations, conducting in-depth market research, and performing comprehensive analyses to support strategic planning. The repository serves as a testament to my ability to integrate creative design with analytical acumen, providing valuable solutions in an urban development context.
